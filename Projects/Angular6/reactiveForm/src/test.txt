Hi Mike,

Create a sample application in angular 4+ (details mentioned below) before the interview. Purpose of this application is to showcase how you utilize the 
arious features offered by angular framework such as (components, services, directives, routing, forms, etc..) 
and apply best practices during development cycle. Also, if you could add some unit test to the code that will be really helpful.

Implement a Form with the following Inputs (and Validators)

Mail address (is required and should be an email address)

A Dropdown which allows the user to select from three different Subscriptions
 ("Basic", "Advanced", "Pro") Set "Advanced" as Default

A Password field (is required and must be 8 character long with at least one character and one special character)

A Submit Button and A Clear Button

  Display a warning message if the Form is invalid and was touched but only after user has stopped typing. 
  Display a warning message below each input if it's invalid and cumulative message at the top of the form with all the errors at the top of the form on submit. 
  If form is modified and clear is clicked, prompt user confirming that they are sure to discard the changes.
  Upon submitting the form, you should simply print the Value of the Form in a separate page.

Thank you 

Rakesh
